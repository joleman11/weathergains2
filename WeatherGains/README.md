Weather Gains is a flexible mod which allows you to multiply the value and quantity of scrap based on the weather.

I suggest that the values in the configuration are reviewed and tweaked based on your preferences. I believe that
the values provided are balanced, but your mileage may vary!

## Features
- Ability to modify the **credit values of scrap** based on the active weather;
- Ability to modify the **amount of scrap** based on the active weather;
- Ability to modify the **value of the Apparatus (Lung) prop** based on the active weather;
- Extremely detailed configuration which allows you to change basically anything about the mod;
- Supports **all** weather types that are currently in Lethal Company (including clear/no weather);
- *May* support other mods that modify the scrap values/amount;
- Open sourced on GitHub
- Tested and functional on v65+ (may work for many older versions, but **use at your own risk**)
